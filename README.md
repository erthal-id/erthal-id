### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Isabela Erthal.<br>
I'm a Biomedical Informatics undergrad @ University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) and I'm looking forward to work in a few areas such as **Data Science**, **Web Development** or **Bioinformatics**.<br><br>
Iâ€™m currently working on a bioinformatics laboratory named Cancer Epigenomics, where we analyse biological data such as gene expression and DNA methylation data to explore some unknown cancer mechanisms ðŸ¤”.<br>
We code in R and we're used to some libraries such as DESeq2, ELMER and TCGAbiolinks.<br><br>
Iâ€™m currently learning Python Framework Django ðŸ˜„.<br><br>
This readme is not done yet, I was just too excited to create one hehe
