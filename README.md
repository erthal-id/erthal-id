### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Isabela Erthal.<br>

I'm a Biomedical Informatics undergrad @ University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) and I'm looking forward to work in a few areas such as **Data Science**, **Web Development** or **Bioinformatics**.<br><br>
Iâ€™m currently doing research in a bioinformatics laboratory named Cancer Epigenomics, where we analyse biological data including gene expression and DNA methylation data to explore some unknown molecular mechanisms ðŸ¤”.<br>
We code in **R** and we're used to some packages like <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html">DESeq2</a>, <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ELMER.html">ELMER</a> and <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TCGAbiolinks.html">TCGAbiolinks</a>.<br><br>
Iâ€™m currently learning Python Framework **Django** ðŸ˜„.<br><br>
I was a project manager in the Biomedical Informatics Junior Enterprise (<a href='https://infobiojr.com.br/'>InfoBio Jr.</a>) and helped developing our Internal Management System called <a href='https://github.com/projetosinfobio/SiGI'>SiGI</a> (it's not ready yet, since it's more of a learning project where the members can use it to improve their developing skills), using some **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, **PHP** and **SQL**.<br><br>

This readme is not done yet, I was just too excited to create one hehe
