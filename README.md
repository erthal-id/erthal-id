### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Isabela Erthal.<br>

I'm a Master student @ University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), and I have a degree in Biomedical Informatics. I'm looking forward to work in a few areas such as **Data Science** and **Bioinformatics**.<br><br>
Iâ€™m currently doing research in a bioinformatics laboratory named Cancer Epigenomics, where we analyse biological data including gene expression and DNA methylation to explore some unknown molecular mechanisms and targets ðŸ¤”.<br>

I was a project manager in the Biomedical Informatics Junior Enterprise (<a href='https://infobiojr.com.br/'>InfoBio Jr.</a>) and helped developing our Internal Management System called <a href='https://github.com/projetosinfobio/SiGI'>SiGI</a> (it's not ready yet, since it's more of a learning project where the members can use it to improve their developing skills), using some **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, **PHP** and **SQL**.<br><br>
I was also a project manager in InfoBio Jr. and led a study group in bioinformatics, we call it InfobioInformatics :) <br><br>
